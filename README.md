## Description
This app is an easy to use budget tracker that will keep track and log all of your incoming funds and expenses so you wont have to ballance a check book ever again. This app uses mongo atlas and heroku to store a users information. This application can also be taken offline so the user does not have to have the internet to keep their account up to date. I struggles with this all a little but thankfully there is so much documentation in the activeties for the last 2 mini projects that I could modify their code slightly and bring this app to life.
